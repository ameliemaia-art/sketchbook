# Tetrahedron 64 Star Variation

The **Tetrahedron 64 Star Variation** is a fascinating and complex structure derived from the arrangement of **64 tetrahedrons**. This variation introduces a star-like configuration, adding layers of symmetry and depth to the original Tetrahedron 64 structure. It is often used in **sacred geometry** and **spiritual practices** to represent the multidimensionality of existence and the interconnectedness of all things. While there is no direct Wikipedia page for the Tetrahedron 64 Star Variation, it is referenced in various discussions of **geometric structures** and **energy fields** in spiritual and metaphysical circles.

## Structure and Geometry

- **64 Tetrahedrons in a Star Formation**: The Tetrahedron 64 Star Variation consists of 64 tetrahedrons arranged in a way that forms a **star-like shape**, often referred to as a **stellated** or **expanded** version of the original Tetrahedron 64.
- This configuration maintains the core structure of 64 tetrahedrons but extends the geometry outward, resulting in a **star tetrahedron** shape that radiates in multiple directions.
- The formation enhances the visual complexity and symmetry of the original arrangement, adding more dimensions of depth and interaction between the tetrahedrons.

## Symbolism and Significance
