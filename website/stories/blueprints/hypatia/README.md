- Expanded on **conic sections**, refining the work of Apollonius of Perga.
- Contributed to the preservation and commentary of **Euclid’s Elements**, helping to ensure its transmission through the ages.
- Developed methods that influenced later algebraic and geometric theories.

### Astronomy

- Worked on the **motion of celestial bodies**, refining Ptolemaic models of planetary motion.
- Contributed to the construction and improvement of **astrolabes** and other astronomical instruments.
- Studied the works of **Ptolemy and Aristotle**, furthering astronomical knowledge in her time.

### Philosophy

- Advocated for **Neoplatonism**, which emphasized logic and rational thought as a means to understand the universe.
- Engaged in philosophical discussions about **the nature of reality, knowledge, and the cosmos**.

## Legacy and Influence

### Intellectual Impact

- Hypatia was regarded as **one of the last great thinkers** of the classical world before the decline of Alexandrian intellectual life.
- Her teachings influenced later philosophers and scientists, contributing to the preservation of Greek mathematical and scientific traditions.

### Martyrdom and Historical Significance

- Hypatia was brutally murdered in **415 CE** by a Christian mob, largely due to political and religious conflicts in Alexandria.
- Her death marked the **symbolic end of classical antiquity** and the shift toward a more religiously dominated medieval world.

### Cultural and Modern Recognition

- Hypatia has been depicted in **literature, film, and historical narratives**, emphasizing her role as a pioneer of women in science.
- Honored as an early advocate of **rational thought, free inquiry, and scientific exploration**.
- Continues to inspire scholars, feminists, and scientists as a **figure of intellectual courage and resilience**.

## Scientific Instruments and Innovations

### The Astrolabe

- A device used to measure the positions of stars and planets.
- Helped in navigation and astronomical calculations.

### The Hydrometer

- Used to measure the **density and gravity of liquids**.
- Played a role in advancements in physics and engineering.

### Geometric Theories

- Explored the relationships between circles, ellipses, and parabolas.
- Influenced the later development of **geometry and calculus**.

## The Ptolemaic Model and Planetary Order

During Hypatia's time, the **Ptolemaic system** was the dominant astronomical model. It placed Earth at the center of the universe, with celestial bodies orbiting in the following order:

1. **Moon**
2. **Mercury**
3. **Venus**
4. **Sun**
5. **Mars**
6. **Jupiter**
7. **Saturn**

Beyond Saturn, the **fixed stars** formed the celestial sphere, enclosing the known universe. Each celestial body was thought to move in a complex system of circular orbits known as **deferents and epicycles**.
